## The Diffing Algorithm

React implements a heuristic O(n) algorithm based on two assumptions:
two elements of different types will produce different trees, and the developer
can hint at which child elements may be stable across different renders with a
`key` prop.

<Quote>
Premature optimization is the root of all evil, but wasted renders in a list of
10,000 items is a user experience nightmare.

## Implementing useMemo

Let's look at a practical example where heavy computation blocks the main thread.
We can wrap the calculation in a `useMemo` hook to cache the result.

<CodeBlock
  code={`import React, { useMemo } from "react";

const HeavyComponent = ({ data, filter }) => {
  // Cache the result based on inputs
  const processedData = useMemo(() => {
    return data
      .filter(item => item.value > filter)
      .map(item => item.x * 2);
  }, [data, filter]); 

  return (
    <div>
      {processedData.map(val => (
        <span key={val}>{val}</span>
      ))}
    </div>
  );
};`}
  language="typescript"
  logic={[
    {
      title: "Input",
      description: "The component receives data and filter props from the parent."
    },
    {
      title: "Check",
      description: "React compares current inputs with previous render's inputs."
    },
    {
      title: "Result",
      description: "Return cached value if inputs match, otherwise recalculate."
    }
  ]}
/>

<KeyTakeaway>
Optimization isn't about making everything fast; it's about avoiding unnecessary
work. By understanding how React's internal mechanisms operate, you can write code that naturally performs
better.
